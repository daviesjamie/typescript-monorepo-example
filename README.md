# Typescript monorepo using npm workspaces

This is an example that demonstrates how to have a single monorepo that
contains multiple typescript packages, which may reference each other.

It makes use of [npm
workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) and [typescript
project
references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html).
